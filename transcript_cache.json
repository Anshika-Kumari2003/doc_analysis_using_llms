they were doing it in secret but they weren't so the year was 2020 covid had descended and just like everyone else I was spending a lot of time online but I was going on a bit of the internet that I think probably fewer people here have actually been on the dark net a bit of the internet that thanks to clever technology encryption basically ensures your anonymity and rumors have swirled around the dark net for years that you could buy anything on the darket that you could buy drugs you could buy guns that you could buy uranium and also you can buy murder on websites like this this is what the website looked like when I first laid eyes on it all those years ago I mean it looks like a website from the 1990s it looks like someone trying to make clip arts as scary as possible uh but the but the offer that the website makes is a serious one this website is saying hey we're the mafia and now you can deal directly with us thanks to the dark net so you go on to this part of the internet you put on you you load in your Alias you type in the message and then it says you can directly transact to have someone killed and so it was that in 2020 a hacker that I was working with a man called Chris Montero he was looking at this website he was probing it he was scanning it he was seeing what he could learn and then a discovery which changed I think both Chris and my life forever momentously Chris found a little vulnerability with the way in which this website worked uh a kind of little technical Gap if you will that he could kind of in a weird way wiggle through and get into the back end of the website and there Chris could see all the kill orders being placed he could see names addresses pattern of Life information Bitcoin payments and all the messages trying to have someone killed so he phoned me so suddenly these were flying in these are by the way the literal actual kill orders we were intercepting on the site I'm not mocking up anything today these are all real so suddenly we were seeing that there was a a hit to uh to kill someone in Amsterdam a simple easy person but high risk of putting me in jail they paid almost $2,000 there was a hit to kill someone in Paris for $1,000 a person that needs to go away her apartment needs to be set on fire a large order to kill someone in Slovakia I need you to take down one guy they say $114,000 there was an order in Hyderabad in India there there was an order in Berlin uh to kill someone probably working from home $21,000 for that one now some of these kill orders were short and Curt and clipped others were long offering lurry justifications as to why it was the right thing that this person had to die and others still they would log in almost every day almost providing like real time updates oh the targets just left the house this is the car they're driving this is how they're going to get to work um but put together we called all of these orders the kill list uh it's it was the single is the single most grotesque disgusting horrible frightening thing I've ever had to read in my entire life uh and it was getting longer all the time so I did what any same person would do I found the police and so it was in the middle of Co the first two strangers that I had seen for months were two somewhat nervous uniform police officers from the Metropolitan Police stood in my kitchen and I laid it all out for them I took them through the website I took them through the hacks I showed them the orders we we' drawn this diagram of how the website worked and they looked at it and they looked at me and they looked at each other and they were unfortunately genuinely quite concerned I was insane and it's a bit of a longer story but ultimately the Mets police decided not to take up an act investigation in the SS but we knew we couldn't step away like these people these people that who whose images we could see who were knew where we Liv these people being targeted they might be in terrible danger you know they might not know that someone out there on the dark net was trying to have them killed so we took a decision uh maybe the most difficult decision I've ever had to make certainly professionally uh and the decision was that I would go and reach the people on the kill list myself directly that I would tell them that someone was trying to kill them and so we sculpted a script we worked with a psychologist we worked out how we were try and soften the blow of being told that someone was trying to kill you and I had to also emotionally Embrace myself for this I readed it the idea that I was about to throw this emotional hand grenade in someone's life it was absolutely awful anyway this is the call no I don't want any information I'm I'm trying to give you information I I don't care I'm sorry okay well thanks for your time anyway um do give me your phone back if youd like more information would we be able to arrange a time um to be able to talk to you at greater length about that thank you thank you thank you okay so you don't you H off with me I mean I wasn't an emotional hand grenade going off in these people's lives I was awful I mean no one believed me you know I spent a week but the the story was so unbelievably Fantastical Dark Net assassins you know kill or ERS that that I just kept getting hung up on for a week so we knew we need to evolve our strategy in quickly so we got local journalists on the scene they believed us to go and directly meet the people on the kill list face to face and the first place we tried to do this was to reach a woman called Elena here in Zurich from the outskirts of Zurich I spoke to the local journalist she she drove up to where El Elena was living she took a deep breath she got out of car and knocked on Elena's front door in 5 minutes into 10 10 into 15 and then at last after an agonizing weight there was Elena on a zoom call a woman whose face had only seen on a Kill Order was there speaking to me and this was the warning I delivered her sorry this is there's no easy way of really saying this um we've come across some information which might mean that someone had put some information regarding you on the site I'm actually not really surprised really in what way I'm having an ugly divorce it's going on for about uh for about 3 years now so uh and uh you know there's money involv quite a lot of money and um my husband uh actually doesn't want to pay it so you know I'm not really surprised she took it unbelievably well now um an important thing to know is that it wasn't just messages going into the site the shadowy people running the site were also replying some of these conversations would go back and forth for weeks or months and we could read all of those as well and what we you know what we realized when we reading all of those was that if there were Hitmen out there these were the most incompetent Hitmen on the face of the planet like they kept losing their weapons or they kept getting lost it' build up to the hit and suddenly the target would be too well protected they'd have to pull out new teams have to come in and every single time the price would go up it became really obvious that there were no shadowy men out there the site had no interest in killing any of these people they were just trying to extort as much money as they could from the people placing the orders but the people placing the orders they of course did not know that they were deadly serious when they tried to have these people killed and nowhere was that lesson Starker than actually with Elena herself so after we spoke to the police so after spoke to Elena we spoke to the police and sometime after that the Swiss police did arrest her husband and only then did we realize that he'd been renting a secret room next to her flat and in this room there was a fck knife a gas mask a telescopic battern a submachine gun a Glock 9mm pistol an AK-47 zip ties a black bin bag black rber gloves um GPS trackers lockpicks that wasn't lesson to us if we needed it the the people writing these orders could be just as dangerous as any Ducket h Hitman so who are these people who are the people writing these orders who is paying $22,000 here for a 5 foot five male with blue eyes to be killed who this isn't doing it she's Kelly Harper Kelly Harper is a a go-getter hospital administrator one-time College sweetheart of the target of the order who'd been locked with him in a bitter years long custody battle that had raged across the courts and the schools and the hospitals of from PR of Wisconsin who's paying $166,000 to have a couple removed someone that they quite don't quote quite see eye to eye on something with which sounds like the understatement of the absolute Century this is a man that's done that Christopher Pence 40-year-old it Microsoft it security technician uh the biological father of 11 children the adopted father of five more children uh a a man a deeply religious Man actually who from a large uh solitary house in a valley in Utah secretly plotted to have the biological parents of his five adoptive children killed this order didn't want the target actually killed this order wanted the target kidnapped and forcibly addicted to heroin the uh the the the order went by the darknet moniker scar 215 and they actually laid out a bonus structure so an additional 10,000 to permanently withdrawal Court motions an additional or 10,000 to keep her mouth shut and tell no one the husband does not know this is happening writes the order any guesses the husband definitely did know this was happening this is the husband Dr Ronald IL uh a neonatologist a doctor a man who ran in a clinic for vulnerable women with addiction issues uh a man who went from a poor rural upbringing in Oregon to a senior City commission and a man obsessed with controlling all the people in his life especially the women a man so devoid of Contrition that after his conviction he's been trying to sell the book rights to his life by describing it as 50 Shades of Gray on steroids and it wasn't just here this was a SportsDirect love triangle in Milton Kings uh this was a woman trying to kill her two parents in Cambra Australia we saw orders in Nevada we saw orders in Tampa we saw orders in Spain we saw orders in Italy we saw orders almost everywhere now we started working in secret with the FBI and we were passing all of our orders to the FBI to give you sense of the scale over the years that we were doing this we disclosed 1075 paid for kill orders around the world 32 arrests so far 28 convictions so far around 180 years of prison time has being sentenced a result of the investigation so far there's probably more to come thanks uh and in case anyone's wondering no we're not still doing this so there's a whole other investigation that we did into people running the site it turns out very likely that they were a group of Romanian cyber criminals and uh and some years ago they were then arrested in a rash of raids across Romania we were then locked out the site uh and yet convictions have continued that we have had nothing to do with and that is the only reason I can stand on this stage today and tell you about any this this is by the way not a story I really thought I would ever be on a stage and able to tell anyone about so it's a spectacular moment for me to be able to finally kind of talk to the world about what we were doing all those long years ago but what where are we left with that's I think the final idea I want to leave us with like what does all of this actually really mean when I first started doing this I thought the kinds of cases that we were going to be dealing with were going to be to do with maybe organized crime big drug deals G and I think the reality is somewhat more unsettling than all of that uh what this website seems to do in the eyes of the orders at least is to make taking out a hit on someone convenient and clean and safe and easy whereas it was was once uh difficult and dangerous and scary it's essentially lowered the barriers to entry to ordering an assassination and I think that that brings us face to face with something that is quite disconcerting the people on this list the kill list and the people that put them there are normal people the perpetrators are basically normal people They have jobs they have friends they go about living their Liv just like you and I you know and they were going about holding all of that down basically at the same time that they were plotting in secret constantly coldly often to have someone killed uh I think that they if there's one thing that unites them all it was often intimate part of Violence by the way spiraling out of control and I think the one thing that unites them all is a desire for control a need to have it an inability to lose it control of a thing control of a relationship of a family and a willingness ultimately of course to kill to get it back but I think that's where we are uh and if there's one thing that I've come away from this whole LED's crazy Journey really thinking we might all be just a little bit closer to the being on a kill list we might like to think thanks very much everyone", "c-mg8UtGvQE": "When we think of early, we tend to picture that moment brave, fierce, fighting solo. We love that image of rugged independence of strike built in solitude. But unfortunately, evolution tells a very different story. And if you want to know how physically unobressive primate managed to become the dominant species on Earth, it wasn't because we're the strongest or the fastest or even the smartest. It was because we're the most connected. Early humans did not muscle our environment. We learned that connected. And when you look back at our evolutionary history, what you find is that solitary living a choice for us. The ones who try to go out alone usually can pass more. But the ones who thrive and pass on their genes and the ones who bound together to hunt together to protect each other to build a society together. This cooperation wasn't just a bonus feature. It was the core aspect of our survival. Now I want you to picture earth 2 million years ago. Vast open savannah, dark forests where predators lay hiding in cold, frigid mountain ranges where survival meant more than just endures. It meant cooperation. Alone, early humans were fragile. We had no claws to tear through, no armor to shield ourselves, and no natural camouflage. Compared to other apex predators, were slow and clumsy. But what's beautiful is when you put a few humans together to protect each other to look out for each other, suddenly the story changed. We built fires to keep ourselves warm. We fashion weapons to protect ourselves. And we learn to track animals with stunning precision. And our social structure evolves to support this as well. Many anthropologists believe that early human groups weren't massive sprawling societies at first. They were small, tight-knit groups around 20 to 50 people. Big enough to share resources, but small enough that everyone maintain a personal relationship. And in those relationships, trust matter. Reputation mattered. Because being selfish might help you out once or twice, but in the long run, getting kicked out of the group was as good as the death sentence. Because cooperation wasn't about kindness, it was about survival. One fascinating theory even suggests that language, one of man's greatest innovations, involved not primarily sharing technical information about how to hunt or gathered, but to gossip. Yes, gossip. Because knowing who could be trusted, who had lied, who had cheated, who had contributed was vital. Language allows us to build a network of relationships far beyond any. And without that web on relationships, without that that trust that tied us together, we would have no humanity. And it wasn't about practical survival either. Early humans meeting each other emotionally as well. Think of the developmental needs of a human baby. They far exceed any other species. I mean, a newborn deer can grow within minutes of being born, but a human baby takes years to become independent. That level of vulnerability forced cooperation. Parents needed help. Hunities needed to pitch in. In ancient times, child rear was shared effort. And it wasn't just parenting either. Older members of the tribe, once too old to hunt or gather, still played a vital role as teachers and storytellers. In fact, many scientists believe the reason we evolved and lived so far past reproductive age was to pass on that older knowledge. Now, as I'm sure you guys can tell, all the paint that rugged lone survivor that we like to mythologize because we're not a species built for assault. We're a species built for belonging. It wasn't just our behavior that helped to support this. Our very brains did, too. Modern science has revealed something amazing about the human mind. Here are yours. They are specialized cells that are believed to be the biological basis of empathy. Because when you see someone stub their toe, you wit. And when you see someone cry, you feel a tug in their gut in your gut. We literally feel each other's emotions because our brains are wired to simulate them. And it's not just a neat feature either. It's a survival technique. Let's go back to that savannah we talked about earlier. You're in the savannah. You with your hunting group and suddenly one of them spots a predator. They freeze at you. They don't say anything. But because of your ability to mirror that emotion because of your ability to feel what they feel, you can react accordingly. And that can be the difference between life and death. Because at that time, emotions weren't private experiences. They were social tools. Tools that we still have today. Think about how infectious laughter can be. One person starts giggling in a meeting and suddenly everyone's laughing without knowing why. Think about how a yawn spreads like wildfire through a classroom or how everyone stops talking for that one suspenseful scene in a movie. I know you need these everyday experiences are echoes of our ancient survival systems. Ones that tell us that we are instinctively the smartest, strongest, and most human when working together. And there's more too. Research from Stanford suggests that our body produces a chemical called oxytocin, often nicknamed the cut chemical. Oxytocin is released when we share meaningful connection. So when you pull a loved one, when you share conversation, even when you contribute to a group project, it lowers stress, increase trust, and boost generosity. And these individual interactions weren't random or chant. They were biological maintenance. Just as food fuels our body today, these connections fuel our survival systems. But despite being wired for connection, modern life pulls us harder. Today, we live in massive cities filled with thousands of people. And yet, we feel more alone than ever. We have more ways to communicate than ever. And yet, many of us struggle with isolation. The Harvard study of adult development, the longest running study of its kind, claimed that the single best predictor of launch of health and happiness wasn't wealth wasn't faith. It wasn't even career success. It was the quality of a person's relationships because strong relationships protected the mind, the body, and even predicted how long someone would live. And on the other hand, loneliness had a terrifying effect. A study conducted by Julia Wston claimed that chronic loneliness was linked to depression, anxiety, and even early death. Her study equated that risk to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. And so what I'm trying to say to you now is that real connection, that messy, imperfect, vulnerable connection is so we crave. It's still what we need. That connection takes time. It takes patience and it takes energy. And in a society that idolizes proficiency and results so heavily, they can often feel expendable. And so more and more we substitute those connections for surface ones, likes for conversations, group chats for campfires, camps and such. And then we wonder surrounded by all these people, why do we feel alone? Well, here's how to fix it. It starts by recognizing that connection isn't a luxury. It's a necessity. It starts by recognizing a vulnerability, the willingness to be seen and heard isn't a weakness. It's a strength. And it starts by recognizing that we were never meant to do life alone. We evolved from the very beginning to belong to each other, to trust in each other, to build bonds that aren't based on transactions, but based on trust. And so the truth is evolution didn't always favor the most generous. It favored the most kind. Because survival was about domination. and self-dedication to each other. Because when one person discovered fire, it wasn't just their survival that changed. The entire groups did. And when one person discovered how to shape a tool, it wasn't hidden. It was shared and grouped upon together. Because knowledge can only grow when it's community. And compassion can only grow when it's nurtured community. Because at the end of the day, we'll never outgrow the need for each other. We are not the strongest. We aren't the smartest. We are not the fastest. But we are the most connected. And that more than anything is why we're still here. Because when one person's fire flickered, another reached over to help light it. And so the next chapter of humanity won't be written by individuals fighting for themselves. It'll be written by communities fighting for each other. Because the greatest strength we have is each other. And the greatest technology we ever invented wasn't the plow or the printing press. It was a circle. The act of facing inward into a fire and sharing stories. And the beautiful thing is is that that fire still burns today. That fire will only burn as long as we're able to keep it lit. So with that, I want to thank you for your time and I ask that you enjoy the next presentations as much as you enjoy mine. Thank you.", "NMfTtS7XT2w": "[Music] [Applause] Imagine yourself at 300 a.m. in the morning stressed, tension, tension about what will happen in future, success, failure. And at that time you need one guiding light, one light that can change you. So here I am the most successful failure. Hi guys, I am Bhabna Singh an image and personality transformation coach. So now when I say the most successful failure, I really mean it. I've been the most successful failure. Does it does this sound something like failure? Then how come you're here, right? So yes, I have seen failures like you see your best friend every day. So they have been part of me. But you know what? I got to know one thing. Those failures, they became my best friends because they taught me one thing in life that if you make your weaknesses your strength, they are your friends. So yes, those weaknesses became my strength. The failures became my friend. And then I started moving towards life. It was not easy. Now let me take you to some flashback of my life. Are you guys interested to hear about that? Yes. Yeah. Okay. So when I started I was studying like you guys. I was in classrooms. My classmates they had a subject like mathematics, social science, English, Hindi, so many but my subject was people. I started reading people. I started observing them. I was checking their body languages. I was checking how they react. So when my classmates they were studying what to do in life, my subject was what not to do in life. And then it was very tough. The journey is very tough when you're walking alone because the whole crowd is going this side and you want this side. It was tough. Then the failures came in because I read it somewhere. If you make a king stand in a circus, circus won't look like a castle. Rather, king would look like a joker. And I was that joker because those things were not meant for me. I was meant for big. I have started manifesting big and then came actually I discovered a success mantra. So I call it 4D success mantra by Bhavna Singh. So if even you guys apply that you might get. So yes, the four Ds were okay let me just divide these four Ds and let me explain it to you how it worked. So first these two D's let's talk about these two Ds. The two D's will come later. So first these two D's came in my life. You know what were they? Darkness and depression. The darkness was so heavy on me at that time that I wanted to give up. Wanted to commit suicide. Wanted to give up life and just leave everything. That darkness was so much on me. It trapped me so bad. And at that young age, I think I was 15, I wanted to give up everything. But that darkness made me realize that go inside you deep inside you and I started searching inside actually I was fighting that light that I should see some light some guiding light I was finding it outside but I was not getting it and I was thinking like there is a saying there's a light at the end of the tunnel but I couldn't see any light. It was all fake. It was all lie. But then that light, I found it inside. The whole universe was inside. And I really thank that darkness that made me realize the darkness that the light is inside. And guess what? My weakness became my strength. The darkness became my strength. That darkness gave me sah right and then there was a depression one D is left here the second two two D's are here and then came the depression now I had to make this depression my friend too actually it made me realize that depression is a very jenzy word like you guys oh I don't have this bag so I'm depressed I I didn't study well. I didn't get good marks. I'm depressed. It's it's like you know very friendly with you nowadays. But that time depression had a different meaning to it. So that depression I got to know the zest of it and the zest was my body gave up on playing a certain character and my body needed a deep rest. See the weakness became my strength and it made me find a different version of me. It stopped playing the character that I was playing before the depression. So I'm thankful to the depression too that it came in my life. But now these two D's had to die because there were two D's waiting for me at the other side of life. You know what were those two D's? They were discipline and dedication. The discipline came and you know what kind of discipline came? If I used to set an alarm at 5:00 a.m. in the morning, it never went 55. It was always five. If there was a discipline of eating such certain things, there was a discipline. I never went out of it. I started taking care of everything that I was doing in a disciplined way, proper way, no shortcuts because I have seen those 2Ds in my life which were really painful yet they gave me life but they were painful. It's very tough to stay there. So then discipline was there and dedication was there. You know I I became like that one lion. You know why lion is a king of a jungle? Do you guys know that there are many animals who are taller, stronger, smarter than lion. But why lion? Because lion is dedicated to one thing that is his hunger. So I was dedicated to one thing that is my hunger to be good to transform myself to evolve myself and to own this world and to the own the room wherever I walk. So that thing gave me life. So guys if you want to find a light outside you're wasting time. I know it's very very easy to motivate and say good motivational things. This very easy to say but I I have seen those days. I was the one who wanted to end up my life twice. I was the one who got married so early because I thought that now life is gone. I have kids. I have everything. Now life is gone. I can't do anything. But no, that sah that was inside made everything lit. in my way. I opened the doors which were closed for me. So sometimes it's not the power of finance, power of emotions or degrees. Sometimes it's in the absence of these things you find success. I was the one. So as I was saying, I'm just 12 pass. I haven't seen colleges like you guys. You're so privileged. I haven't seen it. But yet I'm standing here because of my discipline, dedication and that to never give up formula. I'm not saying that don't study. You guys are privileged enough. Please study. It opens doors for you. But if discipline and dedication is missing, there's no use. If if you are a person who's like a younger bhavna that darkness and depression is you know on me I'm not getting good marks I'm I don't know what to do in life then the life outside is very different it will open doors for you in a very different way but if you have only degrees sorry teachers but if you only have degrees then door might open once twice. But if you don't have a good personality, it's closed. Work on your personalities. Work on yourself. Work how you look. Work how you talk. Work your about your body language. It's very important when you face the real world outside. Okay? Are you guys working on your personalities? The personality is just not a makeup. Girls, huh? Wake up. It's just not makeup. It's so many things attached to a personality. So that's what I do. That's what that's how I transform people. A person who h hasn't been transformed the whole of the life now get into it because she's seen the lowest of the life that if you are not transformed how it felt there, how people treat you outside, right? So you have the privilege. Please take advantage of it and understand one thing in life. And thank you so much Singh. God bless you guys.", "N5vJSNXPEwA": "You and nine other individuals \nhave been captured by super intelligent alien overlords. The aliens think humans look quite tasty, but their civilization forbids eating\nhighly logical and cooperative beings. Unfortunately, they're not sure \nwhether you qualify, so they decide to give you all a test. Through its universal translator, the alien guarding you \ntells you the following: You will be placed in a single-file line\nfacing forward in size order so that each of you can see \neveryone lined up ahead of you. You will not be able to look behind you\nor step out of line. Each of you will have either a black\nor a white hat on your head assigned randomly, and I won't tell you \nhow many of each color there are. When I say to begin, each of you must\nguess the color of your hat starting with the person in the back\nand moving up the line. And don't even try saying words\nother than black or white or signaling some other way,\nlike intonation or volume; you'll all be eaten immediately. If at least nine of you guess correctly,\nyou'll all be spared. You have five minutes to discuss\nand come up with a plan, and then I'll line you up,\nassign your hats, and we'll begin. Can you think of a strategy guaranteed\nto save everyone? Pause the video now \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is that the person \nat the back of the line who can see everyone else's hats\ncan use the words \"black\" or \"white\" to communicate some coded information. So what meaning can be \nassigned to those words that will allow everyone else \nto deduce their hat colors? It can't be the total number\nof black or white hats. There are more than two possible values, but what does have two possible values\nis that number's parity, that is whether it's odd or even. So the solution is to agree\nthat whoever goes first will, for example, say \"black\" if he sees\nan odd number of black hats and \"white\" if he sees \nan even number of black hats. Let's see how it would play out\nif the hats were distributed like this. The tallest captive sees three black\nhats in front of him, so he says \"black,\" telling everyone else\nhe sees an odd number of black hats. He gets his own hat color wrong,\nbut that's okay since you're collectively allowed \nto have one wrong answer. Prisoner two also sees an odd\nnumber of black hats, so she knows hers is white,\nand answers correctly. Prisoner three sees \nan even number of black hats, so he knows that his must be \none of the black hats the first two prisoners saw. Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking for \nan even number of black hats since one was behind her. But she only sees one, so she deduces\nthat her hat is also black. Prisoners five through nine are each\nlooking for an odd number of black hats, which they see, so they figure out\nthat their hats are white. Now it all comes down to you\nat the front of the line. If the ninth prisoner saw \nan odd number of black hats, that can only mean one thing. You'll find that this strategy works\nfor any possible arrangement of the hats. The first prisoner has a 50% chance of\ngiving a wrong answer about his own hat, but the parity information he conveys allows everyone else \nto guess theirs with absolute certainty. Each begins by expecting to see an odd\nor even number of hats of the specified color. If what they count doesn't match,\nthat means their own hat is that color. And everytime this happens, the next person in line will switch\nthe parity they expect to see. So that's it, you're free to go. It looks like these aliens \nwill have to go hungry, or find some less logical \norganisms to abduct.", "iM5GQkJ87Pg": "[Music] So, have you ever seen the horizon? You know where the sea and the sky meet? No matter how far you walk, it always seems to be ahead of you. Dreams also feel the same way sometimes, right? But what if I told you that destiny isn't at the horizon. It's in the steps you're taking right now to reach there. Hello everyone. My name is Mital Ali. I'm 22 years old. A little bit nervous today. This is my first ever TEDex talk and I'm born and brought up in Agra. With this first TEDex talk of mine, allow me to tell you three stories which have literally shaped my life and made me the person I am today. And meanwhile, you also might get to know me a little bit better. Beginning with the first one, which says, \"I'm a firm believer of dreaming big and dreaming the unthinkable.\" Allow me to elaborate. So, I was 17 in my 12th grade, very demotivated, sitting in my small hostel room in the city of Kota and preparing for this humongous exam called NEAt. For those of you who don't know, NE need is a premedical entrance test. Now, it was almost one year to go for my exam and here I am desperately looking for motivation. So, I pick up a chalk and I write on my Almir in my hostel room, neat 2020, all India rank one. Wild and unthinkable, right? Even I knew it. Which is why I wrote it in such a way that only I could see it. Nobody else entering my room would be able to see it. But just for perspective that year, more than 13 lakh students were appearing for this exam. But anyway, cut to 16th October 2020 result day. I'm sitting alone in my room, okay, at home because I'm COVID positive and my laptop in front of me. The site as usual is crashing again and again. I enter my registration number, my do. My heartbeat is racing. My breathing is shallow. My fingers are crossed. The result finally loads and the screen says Mitali Sharma All India rank 68. While this was something Thank you. Thank you. I cannot tell you what happened at my home after this. All forms of social distancing were forgotten. Okay. My dad came into my room after five or seven days and he literally gave me a tight hug. I had never seen my mom and dad this happy at least in my life. Even I cried so many tears of joy because my hard work, my sacrifices, living away from home for two long years in Kota, it was finally making sense, bearing me fruits. But my wild and unthinkable dream of all India rank one wasn't fulfilled, right? And that's exactly the lesson of this first story. And it's also a quote my mom often tells me which is aim for the moon. So even if you miss you may hit a star. And AIR68 was my star moment you guys. It taught me a lot of course to dream big but more than that to believe in my dreams to believe in myself that anything and everything that I want I can achieve it. That's the confidence I gained. It also taught me that hard work is always rewarded. No matter a few weeks, days, months, years later, nobody else might be, but the universe is keeping an account of your hard work. For example, my extremely stressful days back in Kota, which I almost quite literally hated, made MBBS days later in my life seem like a cakewalk and too easygoing. So trust me and take my word on this. If you're going through a rough patch right now in life, life is preparing you for something big. And now that you know me a little bit better, let's get to story number two. Now the title of this story is also a quote by Paulo Coelloo which says when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. I know guys I thought this was Shah Rukh Khan and Omanti but this was originally Paulo Kohello. Now for this story let me take you back to 2015 2014 actually 11 years back I was in my seventh grade and like any other 12year-old extremely excited to enter my teenage and in this era in my life I was too obsessed with Bollywood events award functions you know articles etc etc to an extent that I one day told my mom that I want to grow up and become an actor only to be featured in these articles events etc etc to which my very Indian mom of course replied with two counters number one that students who are good at studies you know they take science and they become doctors engineers and you know don't become actors and her second one which was very important she said that what do you think is becoming an actor that easy or what do you even know how many people go to Bombay every year and they struggle and what a fraction of those people actually become actors Now, this seemed logical to me, but in hindsight, when I look at it, I feel less than 13 lakh, I suppose. But jokes apart, the 12-year-old Mitali, of course, thought to herself that why can't I do both? But, you know, I'm not the elder. I'm the eldest sibling at my house. So, essentially, nobody to guide me or sit me down or tell me that why or why not. Can I do both? So, nothing. Life went on. I forgot this dream of mine. Cut to today. So this good at studies mitali today is just one month away from her final MBBS exams. So one month away from becoming a doctor. But the creative mitali today. She has just crossed 1 million subscribers on her YouTube channel 3 months back. I also hosted an event for YouTube just last year. I also got an article published about me in the newspaper and this was on my birthday by the way last year. [Applause] And I also got interviewed by this very mainstream news company. So essentially all my 12-year-old dreams checked. But that's not it. I took an international solo trip just 2 months back at 22. And you know this last one, it wasn't even a dream I ever saw. It wasn't even a plan I ever had. And you know, Zakir Khan once said in one of his videos. And I think I completely relate. But now when my parents ask me, you know, that they're worried about what would my sisters grow up and do and what should they actually plan for them, I remind them about the plans they had for me, which were very simple and straight by the way, huh? I just had to prepare for my neat UG get a good rank then get into a good MBBS college finish my MBBS my neat PG get a good rank there then do my postgrad and you know get into some sort of private practice or some job and then it's my choice what kind of a doctor do I want to marry but little did we realize that you know when that 12-year-old Matali asked to herself that why can't I do both nobody else might have heard But the universe listened, smiled, and replied, \"So be it.\" She's sitting right here in the first row. [Applause] Huh? Okay. So, this story completely changed my perspective of life. It taught me that no matter how many plans I make for myself, the universe is always going to have better ones. I have decided this one thing. I have stopped asking for anything. When I pray to God, I pray and I tell the universe that allow me and give me the strength and the knowledge to pass through your plan in the best possible way because I know there's no better plan. But this story also taught me one more important lesson that the universe is conspiring but it's also waiting for you to take that first step that leap of faith you know. So I remember when in 2020 COVID happened, lockdown happened and then I had to come back from Kota to Agra and my need was postponed indefinitely and I was extremely burnt out. Okay. So this was my first morning at home and all my clothes are still packed in those suitcases and I was too lazy to unpack. So I took a shower and I wore one of my mom's suit. And now that I was looking pretty and wearing a suit after practically two long years, the classical dancer in me suddenly woke up and it said, \"Why not try that semi-class choreography you saw on YouTube?\" So I was like, \"Okay, can try.\" So I learned this choreography in literally 20 minutes. And then I don't know what in me told me that let's shoot a video. I literally sat on my bed and I adjusted my phone using a water bottle as a stand and I shot my first ever video and practically never stopped and the rest is history. Till date I have put out more than a thousand content pieces on my YouTube channel only by being consistent with my YouTube game. Thank you. Now, this taught me that the universe is conspiring and it got me to shoot that first video, but to keep at it, to keep uploading every day, to learn everything from scratch, from scripting to filming to editing to lighting and to most importantly manage this alongside my MBBS going on was a choice I made for myself. So, the point I'm trying to make here is that you really have to keep at it. There will be situations in life where you feel that nothing is working out for me. Then my friend, you have to get up and make things work out for yourself. That's the only way out. Now this brings me to my third and my last story for the day, which is that when you think that failure has hit you and hit you hard and you know everything is over, fasten your seat belts because it's the beginning of something remarkable. So, as I mentioned, I started content in 2020 and by May 2023, I had got my Instagram page to 60 70,000 followers. And one fine morning, I wake up and I realize that my Instagram account has been hacked and disabled. And after multiple failed attempts of, you know, getting this account back in September, I realized that now this is permanently disabled. So, essentially, no way I'm getting this back. Now I was shocked. I was shook. I had all sorts of negative thoughts in my mind that why is life so unfair to me? Why me etc etc? Because it just might be an Instagram page for everybody else. But it was 3 years of pure hard work for me. And in these days of grief I got back home one day. This was around my Diwali holidays. And I picked up my iPad just as a distraction. I started doing digital art so that I do not think about my Instagram account and be sad. I got so engrossed in this thing, okay, that in the next 5 to 7 days, I came up with a digital calendar and a digital planner for 2024. And before I knew it, I was standing in the streets of Delhi to actively look out for printers to help me get these products printed. And before I could process anything else, I made a website by myself on Wix. I cracked payment gateway on this website. I listed these products on my website and I promoted them using my YouTube channel. And in less than a week, in less than 7 days, I was completely sold out. I didn't have people to help me pack this amount of stock I had to ship out to so many people who had bought this from me. And mind you, this was just two months before my final thirdyear MBBS exams were supposed to happen. So after my exams after my exams when I actually got the time to process that what just happened when I look back I'm genuinely grateful for what happened to my Instagram because had it not been I would have never known that I can practically start up a business okay small business but with zero experience in the middle of my med school just 2 months before my exams without even telling my parents and that too profitable. believe. So the lesson learned here is that you know failure and moments of grief are bound to happen in life and we cannot control them. But what we can control is our reaction to these situations. Do we sit grieve and make them a setback for us or do we actively make them an opportunity in disguise? And so with the limited life experience I've had in my life, I very strongly relate with the theme given to me for the day, which is shitage. You know the horizon where the sea and the sky, your dreams and your destiny meet. One calls you ahead and the other waits for your arrival. And yeah, that brings me to the end of my three stories and also my time limit. But one last thing about me, I'm very fond of poetry. Okay. So, I'd like to end my first TEDex talk with a beautiful one by Feidar Yaz G. It's in Hindi and it goes Let that sink in. Thank you so much everybody.
