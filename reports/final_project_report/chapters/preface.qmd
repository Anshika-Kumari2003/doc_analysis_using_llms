# Preface {.unnumbered}

This project was undertaken as part of the internship program at the **Sabudh Foundation**, with the aim of applying theoretical concepts to real-world problem-solving using modern AI tools and techniques.

The project was allotted to our team to explore how large language models (LLMs), speech recognition systems, and data interaction techniques can be used to simplify access to information across various data formats—documents, videos, and structured spreadsheets. Under the valuable guidance of the Sabudh mentorship team, we worked collaboratively to build a unified solution that demonstrates the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), YouTube transcript analysis, and natural language querying over Excel data.

Throughout this journey, we gained practical exposure to tools such as LangChain, OpenAI Whisper, vector databases, SQL agents, and lightweight LLMs like Phi-3 Mini. We also learned how to design intuitive interfaces using Gradio and Jupyter widgets to make our system accessible and user-friendly.

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the **Sabudh Foundation** for this enriching opportunity and continuous support. We are especially thankful to our project guide, **Mr. Bhupender Sharma**, for his expert mentorship, insightful feedback, and encouragement at every stage of the project. His guidance was instrumental in shaping the outcome of this work.

This experience has significantly enhanced our technical capabilities and understanding of AI-driven systems and will remain a valuable milestone in our academic and professional journey.
